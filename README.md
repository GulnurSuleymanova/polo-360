# Polo360 🌐

Polo360 was one of my **first steps into frontend development**. While building this project, my goal wasn’t just to write code – it was to turn design into a functional, user-friendly, and aesthetic webpage.  

This project became part of my learning journey and laid the foundation for my future works.

- CSS3 (with a little bit of love ✨)  

🎨 Features
- Responsive layout (optimized for both mobile and desktop)
